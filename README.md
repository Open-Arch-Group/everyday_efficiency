## Introduction

An important skill that is seldom taught in schools is how to be efficient in your day-to-day work. Even a talented computer engineer or computer scientist can get bogged down with menial problems like finding files, searching through files, comparing files, etc.. Unfortunately, many people do not use the industry-standard tools and commands simply because they do not know about them. That is where this repository comes in.

This repository contains a number of short guides to introduce readers to the industry-standard tools and commands that may make their lives easier.

## Guide Areas

Guides are broken down into the following top-level areas:

- [Command Line Commands](command_line/)
- [Version Control and Continuous Integration](version_control_and_ci/)
- [Text Editors](text_editors/)
